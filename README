I created this map as part of a leaflet learning exercise. I wanted to figure out how to make a map that would do four things: 

1) feature a draggable marker
2) display a popup message when the marker was clicked
3) change the popup message when the marker was moved to a new location
4) randomly select which message would be displayed from a list of options.
